CKPOOL PROXY

Ultra low overhead massively scalable multi-process, multi-threaded modular
bitcoin mining pool, proxy, passthrough, library and database interface in c
for Linux.

---
DESIGN:

Architecture:
- Passthrough node(s) that combine connections to a single socket which can
be used to scale to millions of clients and allow the main pool to be isolated
from direct communication with clients.
- Proxy nodes with a database that act as a single client to the upstream pool
while storing full client data of their own.
- Simple proxy without the limitations of hashrate inherent in other proxy
solutions when talking to ckpool.

Features:
- Proxy and passthrough modes can set up multiple failover upstream pools.
- Virtually seamless restarts for upgrades through socket handover from exiting
instances to new starting instance.

---
BUILDING:

Building ckpool standalone without ckdb has no dependencies outside of the
basic build tools on any linux installation.

sudo apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev autoconf automake libtool
./autogen.sh
./configure --without-ckdb
make
make install

---
RUNNING:

Run the install-proxy.sh script to setup the proxy with an automatic guide and install it to systemd. This required Debian 8 or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
