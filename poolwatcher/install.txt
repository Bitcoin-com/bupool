To get a log of all empty blocks, allow poolwatcher to write to the file /var/log/emptyblock.log:
sudo touch /var/log/emptyblock.log
sudo chmod a+rw /var/log/emptyblock.log

Next run "poolwatcher -c <config file>".  
It will create a file called /tmp/emptyblock.json that ckpool will read to get empty blocks.  Make sure that poolwatcher has permissions to create a file in /tmp.  Poolwatcher will create this file (empty) on startup so you can easily verify its success.
